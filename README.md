Since PinkCat is on GitHub, users must have a GitHub account in order to access the source code. After accessing the PinkCat repository on either of our GitHub pages, md-hani or sampul25, users must fork the main branch through whatever application they are running it on. Then they must run npm install to acquire all the dependencies and probably npm install --force if there will be warnings. After they installed these dependencies, users must open two terminals and cd into the Backend and Frontend folders. In the backend terminal, users must enter npm run dev and wait for the database to connect. In the frontend terminal, users must type npm start, and PinkCat will boot up.
